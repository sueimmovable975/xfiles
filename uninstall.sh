#!/bin/sh
# xftp uninstaller — finds and removes the xftp, xcp, xfind, xtree, and xsync binaries,
# with an optional follow-up step to remove their config dirs under ~/.config
# (REPL history, cached tokens). POSIX sh, no bash extensions.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/excelano/xfiles/main/uninstall.sh | sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   XFTP_UNINSTALL_YES=1  Skip the binary-removal confirmation (assume yes).
#                        Does NOT imply purge: config dirs are kept
#                        unless XFTP_PURGE=1 is also set.
#   XFTP_PURGE=1          Also remove the ~/.config/{xftp,xcp,xfind,xtree,xsync}
#                        config dirs (history, cached tokens), independent of
#                        XFTP_UNINSTALL_YES.
